        In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)[a] is a
        correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation between two
        sets of data. It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables
        and the product of their standard deviations; thus, it is essentially a
        normalized measurement of the covariance, such that the result always
        has a value between âˆ’1 and 1.
